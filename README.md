# Paranoid Android
This repository contains my submission for Assignment 2 of CP3406 (Mobile Computing). The general gist of this project was to develop an 
android application for early high-school children to develop understanding in a more advanced field. This application is a fairly generic 
quiz style app with questions aimed at basic boolean theory. Please note that this application is a proof-of-concept solution and does not
contain a complete and publishable application.

## Features
Below are some features that improved the overall quality of the final submission:

- **Easy Game Interface -** The game interface is built for use on a wide range of devices with UI layouts produced relative to the 
    orientation of the device
- **Twitter Integration -** Using the Twitter4j library, the user can post their highest score with a custom message as a tweet.
- **Theme Changes -** The application can be recolured to match typical android light/dark themes.
- **JSON Parsing -** All the game assets are loaded through JSON files making a streamlined process for question updates/changes without 
    publishing new versions of the application.
